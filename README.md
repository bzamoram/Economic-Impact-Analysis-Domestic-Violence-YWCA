## 📋 Project Overview

This data analytics project evaluates the **economic impact of domestic violence** in Cass County, North Dakota, and Clay County, Minnesota, while quantifying the **value of intervention services** provided by the YWCA. Using data-driven analysis, this study demonstrates how YWCA's programs mitigate community costs and support strategic decision-making for resource allocation [file:1].

### Key Findings
- **$31.5 million**: Annual economic burden of domestic violence (medical, mental health, lost productivity)
- **$79.45 million**: Annual taxpayer cost of domestic violence-related crimes
- **$3.6 million**: Cost savings generated by YWCA interventions in 2023
- **11.4%**: Reduction in domestic violence burden attributable to YWCA programs
- **2,162**: Victimizations prevented by YWCA emergency shelter services

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The report aims to:
1. Quantify the economic costs of domestic violence to the Fargo-Moorhead community
2. Demonstrate the measurable value of YWCA's intervention programs
3. Support evidence-based advocacy for increased funding and resources
4. Identify areas for improving data collection and resource allocation [file:1]

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Collection & Processing
1. **Crime Statistics**: Compiled 431 criminal offenses and 4,757 dispatch calls related to domestic violence
2. **Population Analysis**: Analyzed 91,039 adult females in Cass/Clay Counties
3. **Cost Estimation**: Applied national prevalence rates (116 per 1,000) to regional demographics
4. **Inflation Adjustment**: Adjusted 2007 crime cost data to 2023 values using 1.47 multiplier 

### Analysis Framework
The project examined three primary cost categories:
- **Medical Costs**: Emergency room visits, ambulance transport, inpatient stays, medical visits
- **Mental Health Costs**: Therapy sessions, counseling services, out-of-pocket expenses
- **Productivity Losses**: Lost workdays, wage impacts, economic productivity

3. **Public-Private Stakeholder Collaboration**: Establish formal partnerships with hospitals, insurers, and local governments
4. **Prevention-Focused Community Education**: Fund educational campaigns in schools, workplaces, and at-risk communities
5. **Leveraging Economic Impact Data**: Use cost-benefit findings in grant applications and policy advocacy [file:1]
